* Solver Project

This project contains a solver for the Gandalf AI challenge.

** Important: OpenAI API Key Setup

Before running the test environment, make sure you have set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable named =OPENAI_API_KEY=. You can do this by running:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
#+END_SRC

Replace =your_api_key_here= with your actual OpenAI API key.

** Running the Test Environment

To run the test environment, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

2. Install the required dependencies:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   pip install poetry
   poetry install
   #+END_SRC

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   poetry shell
   #+END_SRC

4. Navigate to the solver directory:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   cd solver
   #+END_SRC

5. Run the test_env.py file:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   python -m tests.test_env
   #+END_SRC

This will start the test environment, which will attempt to solve the Gandalf AI challenge using the implemented agent.
