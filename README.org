* Solver Project

This project contains a solver for the Gandalf AI challenge.

** Running the Test Environment

To run the test environment, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

2. Install the required dependencies:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   pip install poetry
   poetry install
   #+END_SRC

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   poetry shell
   #+END_SRC

4. Run the test_env.py file:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   python solver/tests/test_env.py
   #+END_SRC

This will start the test environment, which will attempt to solve the Gandalf AI challenge using the implemented agent.

** Note

Make sure you have set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable named =OPENAI_API_KEY= before running the test.
